 First steps : 
 
  In order to start the game, the player needs to select "Start Game" from the menu shown on the LCD screen by pressing the Joysticks button. Moreover, you can scroll through the menu with the X axis of the Joystick to select one of the othre two options : settings and highscore. To win the game, you must pass 5 levels. By default you start from level 1,but you can also select it from settings. The game becomes harder when, level after level, the speed increases. The score will be calculated by the next formula : 10 * level * number of obstacle passed in the current level. You have three chances (lives) to show that you can finish this game ! By losing one life, the game brings you to the beginning of the level, but if you lose all your lives you will need to start from level 1 with score 0. 
  
How to play :
  
  In every level the goal is to pass all the obstacles which will appear in you way. To avoid them, you will use the Joystick in order to move left or right. The obstacles will be marked by red triangles or rectangles on your matrix. Bumping into one obstacle means losing one life.
  Your character will also be one small, red dot on the matrix. 
  Good luck and take care of your dot !
  
 Bonus :
  
  If you manage to finish the game with no lives lost you'll get one extra level in which, in 20 seconds, you should avoid as many obstacles you cand. Pay attention ! If you get hit before the time ends the game will finish ,but you will keep your points.
